# C++ Labs portfolio

A collection of C++ labs demonstrating my learning of C++ language's modern features such as: STL containers, operator overloading, OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) among others.

# Contents

- [Lab 1: Simple Program](lab1-simple-program)
- [Lab 2: String Class](lab2-string-class)
- [Lab 3: Operator Overloading](lab3-operator-overloading)
- [Lab 4: Smart Pointers](lab4-smart-pointers)
- [Lab 5: Pi-Pico Project](lab5-pi-pico)
- [Lab 6: Inheritance](lab6-inheritance)
- [Lab 7: Abstract Class](lab7-abstract-class)

## Highlights

- [Learned how to efficiently use STL containers and corresponding member functions.]
- [Successfully implemented operator overloading.]
- [Explored C++ modern features such as smart pointers (<shared_ptr, <weak_ptr>)]
- [Gained experience in developing for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi Pico) using object-oriented approach.]
- [Applied object-oriented design principles: encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.]
