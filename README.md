# C++ Labs portfolio

A collection of C++ labs demonstrating my learning of modern C++ features, including STL containers and algorithms, operator overloading and and object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).

# Contents

- [Lab 1: Simple Program](lab1-simple-program)
- [Lab 2: String Class](lab2-string-class)
- [Lab 3: Operator Overloading](lab3-operator-overloading)
- [Lab 4: Smart Pointers](lab4-smart-pointers)
- [Lab 5: Pi-Pico Project](lab5-pi-pico)
- [Lab 6: Inheritance](lab6-inheritance)
- [Lab 7: Abstract Class](lab7-abstract-class)

## Highlights

- Learned how to efficiently use STL containers and algorithms to write efficient, maintainable C++ code. 
- Implemented operator overloading for custom classes.
- Applied C++ modern memory management using smart pointers (std::shared_ptr,std::weak_ptr).
- Gained experience in developing for embedded systems (Raspberry Pi Pico) using object-oriented approach.
- Designed software using encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
